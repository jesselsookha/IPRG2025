Chapter 1 

Computer Systems: 
- Hardware 
- Software 
-- Application Software / Apps / Software 
-- Systems Software / Operating Systems 

Programs
- instructions written to perform a task 
- programmers design an algorithm 
- 3 major operations: IPO / Input (1) | Processing (3) | Output (2)
* note the order  

Programming Lanugages 
- syntax - rules that define the structure of statements and expressions  
- compiler - a translator that takes a coded program and converts it to a low-level lang.
- inpterpreter - translates one statement at a time 
- object code - produced by a compiler for the CPU to "execute"

Computer memory: 
- RAM 

Programming Logic 
** key aspects that are mentioned here will be discussed in future chapters 

- variables *remember > x = a + b > now it will be something like: fltWages = intHours * fltRateOfPay
- data types - define the type of data meant to be stored 
- operators - symbols used to perform operations
- control structures - logical structures (sequential, decision, & loop) 
- functions - reusable pieces of code 
- syntax ^ rules that define how programs must be written 


Errors (3 types)
- syntax - errors in the language / the (syntax) code 
- run-time - program executes, but crashes after something occurs
- logical - program executes, but the result is incorrect - programmer's logic is incorrect
