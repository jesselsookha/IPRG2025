# Introduction to Programming Logic [IPRG5111 - 2025]

Welcome to the repository for **Introduction to Programming Logic**! This course introduces the foundational concepts of programming, focusing on programming logic, pseudocode, and flowchart design. By the end of the course, you will be equipped with the skills to approach programming problems using logical structures and visual representation tools.

## Course Overview

In this repository, you'll find materials that will guide you through the chapters and sections of the course. These materials include pseudocode examples, flowcharts, and text files that explain various programming concepts. As the course progresses, new resources will be uploaded, and this README will be updated accordingly.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Pseudocode fundamentals
- Flowchart creation and interpretation
- Basic algorithms and logic structures
- Introduction to programming languages and their syntax
- Problem-solving techniques using logical thinking
