Problem Solving 
(6 Steps of Problem Solving) * while used for everyday types of tasks, it could be adapted to help solve computer related problems -&- in turn help develop computer programs 

1. Identify the problem 
2. Understand the problem 
3. Identify alternative ways to solve the problem
4. Select the best way to solve the problem from the list of alternative solutions 
5. List the instructions that enable you to solve the problem using the selected solution 
6. Evaluate the solution 

Program Development Cycle 
* more catered towards a computer program - but again - relate these steps to the ones we learnt above 

1. Understand the problem 
2. Plan the logic 
3. Code the program 
4. Use software to translate the program into machine language 
5. Test the program 
6. Put the program into production 
7. Maintain the program 

** Both the steps above requires that when do decide - repeat the steps to redevelop and redesign the program

** 2 Types of Solutions 
- algorithmic 
- heuristic 
** search for a meaning to again help you understand these terms for the 2 types of solutions produced

Programming models 
- Procedural - program divided into *functions, procedures, modules, methods - called as needed 
- Object-oriented - program divided into classes that are instantiated to an object and the programming within is called as needed


Pseudocode / Flowcharts 
- algorithm - sequential list of instructions ... 
- standards in code 
-- Start and Stop to begin and end a program 
-- indentation is important to view and read code 
-- Functions / the small blocks of code will require more/different formatting 
-- Functions / will end with a return keyword 
-- Each statement performs one action 
-- No punctuation us used to end statements 
-- Numbering instructions will begin at 0. - Helps to read the coded instructions

0. Start 
1. 	input intNumber 
2. 	intAnswer = intNumber * intNumber
3.	output intAnswer 
4. Stop 

** Flowcharts 
- online use Visio (from the 365 account) or draw.io 
- also need to practice on paper
